1.	Do nothing, see that Speed is 0 and direction is forward.
2.	Press BTN0, see that speed increases to 5.
3.	Press on the middle-right of slider to see a slight right turn.
4.	Wait a few seconds and see that LED1 comes on, indicating a direction violation.
5.	Slide your finger on all other areas of the slider, testing all areas. The direction violation light should
	remain off if you are switching directions quicker than a few seconds between switches. If you lift your finger
	off the slider, the direction should not change from the last selected direction.
	The below regions should be covered:
		a. Hard Left
		b. Slight Left
		c. Forward
		d. Slight Right
		e. Hard Right
6.	Wait a few seconds and again see the direction light come on.
7.	Press BTN0 and BTN1 to increase and decrease the speed, it should increase by 5 when BTN0 is pushed,
	and decrease by 5 when BTN1 is pushed, going down as far as '0' and going up as high as you want.
8.	Increase the speed to '50' or above.
9.	Move your finger to all regions of the slider. LED0 should be on whenever you are not going forward (any turns
	over 45 are a speed violation) and off when you are going forward.  The same direction violation functionality should
	work if you are going the same direction for more than a few seconds, regardless of speed violation.
10.	Increase speed to above '75' and move your finger to all regions of the slider.  LED0 should be on regardless of 
	direction (including forward) since 75 is the speed limit.  The same direction violation functionality should work if you 
	are going the same direction for more than a few seconds, regardless of speed violation.
11.	Decrease speed to 0, and see that both violation LEDs turn off.
12.	Attempt to reduce the speed below 0, see that you cannot.
